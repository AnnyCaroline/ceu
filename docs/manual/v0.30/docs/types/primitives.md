## Primitives

CÃ©u has the following primitive types:

```ceu
none               // void type
bool               // boolean type
on/off             // synonym to bool
yes/no             // synonym to bool
byte               // 1-byte type
int      uint      // platform dependent signed and unsigned integer
integer            // synonym to int
s8       u8        // signed and unsigned  8-bit integers
s16      u16       // signed and unsigned 16-bit integers
s32      u32       // signed and unsigned 32-bit integers
s64      u64       // signed and unsigned 64-bit integers
real               // platform dependent real
r32      r64       // 32-bit and 64-bit reals
ssize    usize     // signed and unsigned size types
```

<!--
The types that follow are considered *integer types*:
`byte`, `int`, `uint`, `s8`, `u8`, `s16`, `u16`,
`s32`, `u32`, `s64`, `u64`, `ssize`, `usize`.

See also the [literals](#TODO) for these types.
