## Types

CÃ©u supports type checks and casts:

```ceu
Check ::= Exp is Type
Cast  ::= Exp as Type
```

### Type Check

A type check evaluates to *true* or *false* depending on whether the runtime
type of the expression is a subtype of the checked type or not.

The static type of the expression must be a supertype of the checked type.

Example:

```ceu
data Aa;
data Aa.Bb;
var Aa a = <...>;       // "a" is of static type "Aa"
<...>
if a is Aa.Bb then      // is the runtime type of "a" a subtype of "Aa.Bb"?
    <...>
end
```

### Type Cast

A type cast converts the type of an expression into a new type as follows:

1. The expression type is a [data type](../statements/#data):
    1. The new type is `int`:
        Evaluates to the [type enumeration](../statements/#data) for the
        expression type.
    2. The new type is a subtype of the expression static type:
        1. The expression runtime type is a subtype of the new type:
            Evaluates to the new type.
        2. Evaluates to error.
    3. The new type is a supertype of the expression static type:
        Always succeeds and evaluates to the new type.
        See also [Dynamic Dispatching](../statements/#dynamic-dispatching).
    4. Evaluates to error.
2. Evaluates to the new type (i.e., a *weak typecast*, as in C).

Examples:

```ceu
var Direction dir = <...>;
_printf("dir = %d\n", dir as int);

var Aa a = <...>;
_printf("a.v = %d\n", (a as Aa.Bb).v);

var Media.Video vid = <...>;
await/dynamic Play(&m as Media);

var bool b = <...>;
_printf("b= %d\n", b as int);
```
