## Relational

CÃ©u supports the relational expressions *equal-to*, *not-equal-to*,
*greater-than*, *less-than*, *greater-than-or-equal-to*, and
*less-than-or-equal-to* through the operators that follow:


```ceu
    ==      !=      >      <      >=      <=
```

Relational expressions evaluate to *true* or *false*.
