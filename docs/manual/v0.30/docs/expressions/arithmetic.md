## Arithmetic

Céu supports the arithmetic expressions *addition*, *subtraction*,
*modulo (remainder)*, *multiplication*, *division*, *unary-plus*, and
*unary-minus* through the operators that follow:

```ceu
    +      -      %      *      /      +      -
```

<!-- *Note: Céu has no support for pointer arithmetic.* -->
